<h4>AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine</h4>
<p>
The Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, codenamed AZD1222,[5] and sold under the brand names Covishield[17] and Vaxzevria[1][18] among others, is a viral vector vaccine for prevention of COVID-19. Developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, it is given by intramuscular injection, using as a vector the modified chimpanzee adenovirus ChAdOx1.[19][20][21][22] The efficacy of the vaccine is 76.0% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 beginning at 22 days following the first dose and 81.3% after the second dose.[23]

The vaccine has a good safety profile, with side effects including injection-site pain, headache, and nausea, all generally resolving within a few days.[24] More rarely, anaphylaxis may occur (the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has 268 reports out of some 21.2 million vaccinations as of 14 April 2021).[24] In very rare cases (around 1 in 100,000 people) the vaccine has been associated with an increased risk of blood clots in combination with low levels of blood platelets.[25][26][27] According to the European Medicines Agency as of 4 April 2021, 222 cases of blood clots have been reported from the European Economic Area and the UK, where around 34 million people have received the vaccine.[28]

On 30 December 2020, the vaccine was first approved for use in the UK vaccination programme,[12][29][30] and the first vaccination outside of a trial was administered on 4 January 2021.[31] The vaccine has since been approved by several medicine agencies worldwide, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA),[1][14] and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration,[7] and was approved for an Emergency Use Listing by the World Health Organization (WHO).[32] Some countries have limited its use to elderly people at higher risk for severe COVID-19 illness due to concerns over the very rare side effects of the vaccine in younger individuals.[33]
</p>
<h3>Medical Uses</h3>
<p>The Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine is used to provide protection against infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in order to prevent COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and older.[1] The medicine is administered by two 0.5 ml doses injected intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle (upper arm) four to twelve weeks apart, with the WHO recommending the second is given 8 to 12 weeks after the first for optimum efficacy.[34]

Efficacy
An analysis published on 19 February 2021 showed an efficacy of 76.0% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 beginning at 22 days following the first dose, increasing to 81.3% when the second dose is given 12 weeks or more after the first.<
</p>

<h3>Adverse Effects</h3>
<p>
The most common side effects in the clinical trials were usually mild or moderate and got better within a few days after vaccination.[27]

Vomiting, diarrhoea, swelling, redness at the injection site and low levels of blood platelets occurred in less than 1 in 10 people.[27] Enlarged lymph nodes, decreased appetite, dizziness, sleepiness, sweating, abdominal pain, itching and rash occurred in less than 1 in 100 people.[27]

In very rare cases (around 1 in 100,000 people) the vaccine can lead to blood clots in combination with low levels of blood platelets.[25] The UK MHRA as of 14 April 2021 report an overall case incidence of thromboembolic events with concurrent low platelets of 7.9 per million doses (less than 1 in 100,000 people).[24]

As with other vaccines, anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions are a known side effect of ADZ1222 that should be given under close supervision.[35][27] The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has assessed 41 cases of anaphylaxis from around 5 million vaccinations in the United Kingdom.[35][36]

<h3>Pharmalogy</h3>
<p>
The Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is a replication-deficient simian adenovirus vector, containing the full‐length codon‐optimised coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein along with a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence.[37][38]

The adenovirus is called replication-deficient because some of its essential genes were deleted and replaced by a gene coding for the spike protein. Following vaccination, the adenovirus vector enters the cells and releases its genes, which are transported to the cell nucleus; thereafter the cell's machinery does the transcription into mRNA and the translation into proteins.[39]

The protein of interest is the spike protein, an external protein that enables the SARS-type coronavirus to enter cells through the enzymatic domain of ACE2.[40] Producing it following vaccination will prompt the immune system to attack the coronavirus through antibodies and T-cells if it later infects the body.[4]
</p>

<h3>Manufacturing</h3>
<p>
The vaccine is stable at refrigerator temperatures and costs around US$3 to US$4 per dose.[41] On 17 December 2020, a tweet by the Belgian Budget State Secretary revealed that the European Union (EU) would pay €1.78 (US$2.16) per dose, The New York Times suggesting the lower price might relate to factors including investment in vaccine production infrastructure by the EU.[42]
As of March 2021 the vaccine active substance (ChAdOx1-SARS-COV-2) is being produced at several sites worldwide,[43] with AstraZeneca claiming to have established 25 sites in 15 countries.[44] The UK sites are Oxford and Keele with bottling and finishing in Wrexham.[43] Other sites include the Serum Institute of India at Pune.[43] The Halix site at Leiden was approved by the EMA on 26 March 2021, joining three other sites approved by the EU.[45]

<h2><u><mark>Covaix</mark></u></h2>
<p>
Covaxin (codenamed as BBV152) is an inactivated virus-based COVID-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research.
 </p>
 <h3>Technology</h3>
 <p>
As an inactivated vaccine, Covaxin uses a more traditional technology that is similar to the inactivated polio vaccine. Initially, a sample of SARS-CoV-2 was isolated by India's National Institute of Virology and used to grow large quantities of the virus using vero cells. From then on, the viruses are soaked in beta-propiolactone, which deactivates them by binding to their genes, while leaving other viral particles intact. The resulting inactivated viruses are then mixed with an aluminium-based adjuvant.
</p>

<h3>Clinical research</h3>
<p>Phase I and II trials
In May 2020, Indian Council of Medical Research's (ICMR's) National Institute of Virology approved and provided the virus strains for developing a fully indigenous COVID-19 vaccine.[2][3] In June 2020, the company received permission to conduct Phase I and Phase II human trials of a developmental COVID-19 vaccine codenamed BBV152, from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), Government of India.[4] A total of 12 sites were selected by the Indian Council for Medical Research for Phase I and II randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trials of vaccine candidate.[5][6][7]

In January 2021, the company published Phase I trial results in The Lancet.[8] On March 8, 2021, Phase II results were published in The Lancet. The study showed that Phase II trials had a higher immune response and induced T-cell response due to the difference in dosing regime from Phase I. The doses in Phase II were given at 4 weeks interval as opposed to 2 weeks in Phase I. Neutralization response of the vaccine were found significantly higher in Phase II.[9]

Phase III trials
In November 2020, Covaxin received the approval to conduct Phase III human trials after completion of Phase I and II.[11] A randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study among volunteers of age group 18 and above, it started on 25 November and involved around 26,000 volunteers from across 22 sites in India.[12][13][14] Refusal rate for Phase III trials was much higher than that for Phase I and Phase II. As a result, only 13,000 volunteers had been recruited by 22 December with the number increasing to 23,000 by 5 January.[15][16]

Multiple ethical breaches have been reported at one of their trial sites in Bhopal, potentially hampering the quality of overall data

In April 2021, Bharat Biotech reported via a press-release that efficacy is 78%, in its interim analysis of its phase 3 trial [unreliable medical source?]

B.1.1.7 variant (first discovered in United Kingdom)
In December 2020, a new SARS‑CoV‑2 variant, B.1.1.7, was identified in the UK. An in vitro study on this variant was carried out and preliminary results show Covaxin to be effective in neutralizing this strain.[23]

B.1.617 variant (first discovered in India)
In April 2021, the Indian Council of Medical Research reported that the vaccine has shown promising results in neutralizing the strain B.1.617.[24][25]

P.2 variant (first discovered in Brazil)
In May 2021, a joint investigation by the scientists of National Institute of Virology (NIV) India, found the vaccine effective in neutralizing the P.2 (previously known B.1.1.28) strain.[26]

Manufacturing
The vaccine candidate is produced with Bharat Biotech's in-house vero cell manufacturing platform that has the capacity to deliver about 300 million doses. The company is in the process of setting up a second plant at its Genome Valley facility in Hyderabad to make Covaxin. The firm in collaboration with Government of Odisha is establishing another facility at Odisha Biotech Park in Bhubaneswar to commence Covaxin production by June 2022.[29][30] Besides this, they are also exploring global tie-ups for Covaxin manufacturing.[31]

In December 2020, Ocugen, Inc. entered into a partnership with Bharat Biotech to co-develop Covaxin for the U.S. market.In January 2021, Precisa Med entered into an agreement with Bharat Biotech to supply Covaxin to Brazil.[34]

In May 2021, Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited of Haffkine Institute entered into a memorandum of understanding with Bharat Biotech and announced that the production of Covaxin by them will commence after obtaining support from the Maharashtra state government and approval from the Indian government[35] whereas Indian Immunologicals Limited (IIL) has signed a commercial agreement with Bharat Biotech for producing the drug substance, a critical component of the vaccine[36] Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Corporation (BIBCOL) will also manufacture the vaccine.

<h2><u><mark>Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine</mark></u></h2>
<p>
Sputnik V (Russian: Спутник V) is an adenovirus viral vector vaccine for COVID-19 developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. It was registered on 11 August 2020 by the Russian Ministry of Health as Gam-COVID-Vac (Russian: Гам-КОВИД-Вак, romanized: Gam-KOVID-Vak).[2][3] The 'V' in its name is the letter and not the Roman numeral.[4][5]

Gam-COVID-Vac was initially approved for distribution in Russia and then in 59 other countries (as of April 2021) on the preliminary results of Phase I–II studies eventually published on 4 September 2020. Approval in early August of Gam-COVID-Vac was met with media criticism in mass media and discussions in the scientific community as to whether approval was justified in the absence of robust scientific research confirming safety and efficacy.[2][3][7][8][9] On 2 February 2021, an interim analysis from the trial was published in The Lancet, indicating 91.6% efficacy without unusual side effects.[10]

Emergency mass-distribution of the vaccine began in December 2020 in countries including Russia, Argentina, Belarus, Hungary, Serbia and the United Arab Emirates. By February 2021 over a billion doses of the vaccine had been ordered for immediate distribution globally
</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>
Gam-COVID-Vac is a viral two-vector vaccine based on two human adenoviruses – a common cold virus – containing the gene that encodes the full-length spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 to stimulate an immune response.[6][12][13] The Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine was developed by a cellular microbiologists team of the government-backed Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. The group was led by MD and RAS associate member Denis Logunov, who also worked on vaccines for the Ebolavirus and the MERS-coronavirus.[14]

The recombinant adenovirus types 26 and 5 are both used as vectors in the vaccine. They were biotechnology-derived and contain the SARS-CoV-2 S protein cDNA. Both of them are administered into the deltoid muscle: the Ad26-based vaccine is used on the first day and the Ad5 vaccine is used on the 21st day to boost immune response.[12][15][16]

Both Ad26 and Ad5 were modified to remove the E1 gene to prevent replication. Large quantities of both adenoviruses are then produced by HEK 293 cells that have the E1 gene necessary for viral replication. Rarely, Ad5 can acquire the E1 gene from the HEK 293 cells, restoring its ability to replicate. Gamaleya has set an acceptable limit of 5,000 replicating virus particles per vaccine dose, and quality control documents state that tested batches contain less than 100 replicating virus particles per dose.[17]

The vaccine can be formulated in two ways: as a ready-to-use solution in water that is frozen at the common home-freezer storage temperature of −18 °C or 0 °F or lower; and as a freeze-dried powder, "Gam-COVID-Vac-Lyo", whose storage temperature is above freezing, 2–8 °C or 36–46 °F, at the common home-refrigerator temperature. The freeze-dried powder must be reconstituted with water before use.[18]

The production of the frozen liquid formulation was developed for large-scale use, it is cheaper and easier to manufacture.

The production of the freeze-dried formulation takes much more time and resources, although it is more convenient for storage and transportation. It was developed with vaccine delivery to hard-to-reach regions of Russia in mind.[19]

The head of the Gamaleya Research Institute Alexander Ginzburg estimates that it will take 9–12 months to vaccinate the vast majority of the Russian population, assuming in-country resources are adequate.[20][21]

Sputnik-Light, a single-dose version, is also being developed to speed up vaccination outside Russia. It will offer less protection than the two-dose versions, but it is still expected to reach an efficacy of 85%.

<h3>Clinical research</h3>
<p>
Phase I–II
A phase I safety trial began on 18 June 2020.[2] On 4 September 2020, data on 76 participants in a phase I–II trial were published, indicating preliminary evidence of safety and an immune response.[6] The results were challenged by international vaccine scientists as being incomplete, suspicious, and unreliable when identical data were reported for many of the trial participants,[24] but the authors responded that there was a small sample size of nine, and the measured results of titration could only take discrete values (800, 1600, 3200, 6400). Coupled with the observation that values tended to reach a plateau after three to four weeks, they contend that it is not unlikely that several participants would show identical results for days 21 to 28.[25]

Phase III

Sputnik V, efficacy for different conditions. The error bars indicate the confidence interval containing the efficacy with 95% probability
In early November 2020, Israel Hadassah Medical Center director-general Prof. Zeev Rotstein stated that Hadassah's branch in Moscow's Skolkovo Innovation Center was collaborating on a phase III clinical trial.[26]

The ongoing phase III study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre clinical trial involving 40,000 volunteers in Moscow, and is scheduled to run until May 2021.[27] In 2020–2021, phase III clinical studies were also being conducted in Belarus,[28] UAE,[29] India[30] and Venezuela.[31]

On 2 February 2021, an interim analysis from the Moscow trial was published in The Lancet, indicating 91.6% efficacy (95% CI 85.6–95.2) after the second vaccination, without unusual side effects.[32] The trial started on 7 September 2020 using the frozen liquid form of the vaccine, and data was analysed up to the second database lock on 24 November 2020. The over-60-years-old group in the trial (oldest participant was 87) had essentially the same efficacy (91.8%) as for all ages. The lowest age participants were 18 years old.[10][33]

On April 13, 2021 India's health ministry said its drug regulator had found that safety and immunogenicity data from a local trial of Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine was comparable to that of a late-stage trial done in Russia.[34]

Sputnik V – AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trials
On 21 December 2020 the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the Gamaleya National Center, AstraZeneca and R-Pharm signed an agreement aimed at the development and implementation of a clinical research program to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the combined use of one of the components of the Sputnik V vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Center, and one of the components of the AZD1222 vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford.[35] The study program will last 6 months in several countries, and it is planned to involve 100 volunteers in each study program. On 9 February 2021, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Azerbaijan allowed clinical studies in the country for the combined use of the Sputnik V vaccine and the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca, stating that the trials would begin before the end of February 2021.[36][37] On February 20, 2021 in the official Sputnik V Twitter account it was stated that clinical trials have already started.
